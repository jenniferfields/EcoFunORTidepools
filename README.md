**Contents:** There are four folders, R project, and a README.md file.

**Folders:**
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
**[Data/Clean Data](https://github.com/jenniferfields/EcoFunORTidepools/tree/master/Data)**

Contains all clean and raw data from project. Within this folder there are four folders for data from 
1. Tide pool physical parameters
2. Community composition
3. Light and temperature loggers
4. Biogeochemistry sampling

**[Coding scripts](https://github.com/jenniferfields/EcoFunORTidepools/tree/master/Scripts)**
Contains all code for project. Within this folder there are six files
1. [Tide pool physical parameters script](https://github.com/jenniferfields/EcoFunORTidepools/blob/master/Scripts/tidepoolphysicalparameters.R) 
including calcuations for tide pools volumes 
2. [Community compositon script](https://github.com/jenniferfields/EcoFunORTidepools/blob/master/Scripts/CommunityComp.R)
including nMDS plot code and PERMANOVA analysis and community composition supplemental material plots
3. [Temperature and light script](https://github.com/jenniferfields/EcoFunORTidepools/blob/master/Scripts/TemperatureandLight.R) 
including temperature and light logger data cleaning and month-long temperature and light analyses
4. [Carbonate and biogeochemistry script](https://github.com/jenniferfields/EcoFunORTidepools/blob/master/Scripts/CleanCarbChem.R) 
including carbonate chemistry and ecosystem metabolism (NEC and NEP) calculations as well as biogeochemistry Principal Component Analyses of tide pools and adjacent ocean
5. [Structural Equation Model script](https://github.com/jenniferfields/EcoFunORTidepools/blob/master/Scripts/SEMScript.R) 
including structural equation model input data, PiecewiseSEM model framework, and significant marginal effect plots. Note: This script ultilizes output from both carbonate and biogeochemistry and community composition scripts
6. [DAG of Structural Equation Model script](https://github.com/jenniferfields/EcoFunORTidepools/blob/master/Scripts/DAGSEMscript.R) 
including code using DiagrammeR to create SEM figures
