For Supplemental Figure 5, we obtained data from Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife Marine Resources Program through a formal data use agreement process. 
The data we received was temperature data from 1m SMURF mooring sensors at Otter Rock Marine Reserve. These data included shallow (1m) temperature sensor data from 6/16-8/17/2019.
